# Note-Link

**Goal:** To create a website where users can create notes and share them using locally-generated links.

My motivation for working on this project was to learn Full-Stack Development. This project implements the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) Stack to create an interactive website. This project is divided into two parts: backend and frontend. The backend contains files/folders that implement CRUD for backend operations. The frontend contains files/folders that implement a React frontend for the website.

### Checklist

This is a checklist for some future plans I have for this project.

- [x] Create a website using technologies from the MERN Stack. 
- [x] Host the website on a cloud platform, such as Render.
- [ ] Implement authentication/authorization to allow for user/member sign-up and login.
